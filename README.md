# Event Builder

## Overview

Event Builder allows for the creation of events involving people, places and objects from specific sections of TEI
documents.

Container elements (`item`, `seg`, `p` or `div`) allow the TEI document to be broken into selectable sections,
and people, places and objects to be extracted from each section. Acquisition, production, observation and
production events can then be constructed from that extracted data.

## Installation and Usage

Documentation on [installing](docs/INSTALL.md) and [using](docs/README.md) this software can be found in the
